Password managers have emerged as a solution to having to track all the various passwords across the digital sphere. This prevents mix-up of passwords belonging to different accounts or/and also prevents one from forgetting passwords created for different accounts especially if they have many different accounts. It Lays a foundation for the user to find a sense of accountability and responsibility.
A password manager allows individuals and businesses to save and manage all their passwords from one safe space. Thus, users will no longer be required to remember multiple passwords. It saves passwords for their respective accounts and can only be unlocked by the administrator in charge of those accounts.The passwords are stored in an encrypted vault that can only be accessed by someone with the right credentials.
Programming Language Applied is Python where there was use of the 
fernet key.
